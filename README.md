# opengolf-server

Spring boot application integrated with AWS Cognito and AWS Elastic Search. Provides a Swagger/API interface to view the remote course database. Allows authorized users to add, edit and delete courses.

Remote course database contains a VERY limited dataset of courses I personally play regularily.
